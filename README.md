# python_doodles
A collection of Python-related doodles. Mostly written in python 3, and mostly unfinished and unreliable.

If interested in graphmap.py or graphs in general, please use a proper graph-manipulation library like NetworkX, which is bound to have better performance and stability.

The codewars and other exercise solutions are as-is, and just reflect the approach I took at the time when first learning that concept. Feel free to read them and the approach taken (here, or on the relevant website), but please don't attempt to submit them as your own work as that rather defeats the purpose and spirit of doing the coding exercises.
